## Rules for any code that uses pydantic-schemaforms

These apply to every task. Read them before writing code.

1. **Treat the library as a dependency.** Never edit, copy or vendor its source into the app, and
   never import from its submodules (`pydantic_schemaforms.inputs`, `.rendering`, `.templates`,
   `.tstring`, `.validation`, `.live_validation`, ...). Everything app code needs is exported from
   the top level: `from pydantic_schemaforms import FormModel, Field, html, ...`. If a name won't
   import from there, re-check its spelling before looking anywhere else.
2. **A form is a `FormModel`.** It's a Pydantic `BaseModel` subclass, so the model is the form, its
   validation and its data. Ordinary Pydantic is expected: `@field_validator`,
   `@model_validator`, `EmailStr`, `Enum`, `Literal`, `Optional`, `create_model()`.
3. **Use what's built in before writing code.** Formatted inputs (phone, currency, tags, ratings,
   date formats, file upload), repeating sub-forms, layouts, wizards and CSV-import tables are all
   `Field(...)` settings or nested models, not HTML or JavaScript you write.
4. **Constraints validate; `ui_options` only decorates.** `min_length`, `max_length`, `pattern`,
   `ge`, `le`, `gt`, `lt` and `multiple_of` go on `Field()`: they're checked on submit, and most
   also become HTML attributes so the browser checks them first. The same value in `ui_options` is never checked on the server.
5. **Build HTML around user data with `html(t'...')`.** A value that passed `validate()` can still
   contain `<script>`. `html()` takes a Python 3.14 t-string and escapes every interpolated
   value; an f-string or `.format()` doesn't. Output the library rendered (`render_form_html()`,
   `render_with_errors()`) is already safe and can be placed as is.
6. **Mistakes fail silently, so check names.** An unknown `ui_element` renders a plain text box, an
   unknown `ui_options` key becomes an HTML attribute, and a misspelled `framework` falls back
   to another style. None of them raise. The frameworks are `"bootstrap"`, `"material"` and
   `"none"`.
7. **`EmailStr` needs the `email` extra** (`pydantic-schemaforms[email]`) just to define the
   model. Add it to the app's dependencies whenever a form has an email field typed `EmailStr`.
